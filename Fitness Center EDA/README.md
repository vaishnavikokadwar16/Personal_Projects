**Problem Statement**
<br>
<br>
Pretend that you are being given a chance to win work from the fitness center client. The work will be to address their concerns around customer churn – their explanation of the problem can be found in the Module 4 tab under the name <Fitness Center CMO>. 
<br>
You will be sending them a proposal in a week or two explaining how you will tackle the problem, and that proposal will be evaluated critically against those of possible competitors.
<br>
To help you with your pitch, the fitness center client has provided a dataset containing some of their data, found in the Modules tab under the name <Fitness Center Data>. You are allowed to study the data and also allowed to send a short list of questions to the client to help you create your proposal.
<br>
Review the data, conduct EDA, and consider possible solutions.
<br>
Submit a 3–4 page Word or PDF document with your answers to the following questions. Write this document as though it were for a potential client who has not yet decided to hire you.  You will want to appear professional, respectful of their time, and aware of their industry context as well as their data science needs.
<br>
1. What do you consider the specific business problem and the matching goal of analysis?
2. What modeling approach do you suggest and what did you notice in the data that suggests it will be helpful here?
3. What questions, if any, do you have about the client organization, or its broader industry? Try not to ask questions that make you seem disengaged or uninformed.  If you need answers from specific employees within the fitness center, be sure to name the role/position you have in mind.
4. What questions, if any, do you have about the data? This could include the data collection practices, the availability of other columns or datasets, potential data quality issues, etc.  Try to ask questions that are immediately relevant to crafting a successful proposal.
