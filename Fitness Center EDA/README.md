**Problem Statement**
<br>
<br>
Pretend that you are being given a chance to win work from the fitness center client. The work was to address their concerns around customer churn. 
<br>
To help you with the analysis, the fitness center client has provided a dataset containing some of their data. 
<br>
The Python files, documents and presentation address the following questions:
1. What do you consider the specific business problem and the matching goal of analysis?
2. What modeling approach do you suggest, and what did you notice in the data that suggests it will be helpful here?
3. What questions, if any, do you have about the client organization or its broader industry? Try not to ask questions that make you seem disengaged or uninformed.  If you need answers from specific employees within the fitness center, be sure to name the role/position you have in mind.
4. What questions, if any, do you have about the data? This could include the data collection practices, the availability of other columns or datasets, potential data quality issues, etc.  Try to ask questions that are immediately relevant to crafting a successful proposal.

The various methodologies used for churn prediction are:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis of various features that could potentially be responsible for churn
2. Monthly churn trends based on customer characteristics
3. Identification of customer groups who are most likely to churn
4. Retention strategies for various customer groups to increase their engagement and incentivize their visits
