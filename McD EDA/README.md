**Problem Statement / Business Problem**

Review the following three files, also found in this folder:
<br>
<Weekly sales CSV>
<br>
<Restaurant facts CSV>
<br>
<Data dictionary XLS>
<br>
Perform an exploratory data analysis on the files above. Some of the work you do here will probably never be seen by anyone else.  However, to understand the data, you should at a minimum take the following steps:
<br>
1. Examine the distribution/frequency counts of each variable
2. Examine the missingness of each variable, especially “unexpectedly missing” values
3. Determine whether any variable suffers from apparent quality control issues, such as data entry errors, or rows which do not seem relevant to the issue at hand
4. Determine any formulaic connections between columns and confirm that the formula always works in each row
5. Search for clusters or subgroups of observations which seem to “behave” differently than the rest
<br>
Submit a Word or PDF document with your answers to the following questions. Include any graphs or tables or sample rows which help support your answers, but do not include your script or any raw terminal output:
<br>
1. What is the business problem as you understand it?
<br>
2. What variables in the data relate most directly to the business problem?
<br>
3. Are there any data quality concerns with these variables?
<br>
4. Do you have any hypotheses about how the data could help to answer the business problem?
<br>
5. Are the data likely sufficient to confirm or reject your hypotheses? Consider data completeness, data quality, and methodological assumptions in your answer.  If not, what additional data or corrective measures are needed?
