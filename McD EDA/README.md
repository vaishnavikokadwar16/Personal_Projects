**Problem Statement / Business Problem**

The McDonald's Sales data helps us understand the effect of the All-Day breakfast promotions that the company ran several years ago. This project aims to determine the success of this promotion based on various metrics like revenue growth, customer retention, new customer initiation, operational challenges, etc.

The dataset has 3 data tables:
<br>
Weekly sales CSV
<br>
Restaurant facts CSV
<br>
Data dictionary XLS
<br><br>
This project performs an exploratory data analysis on the files above, including the following steps:
<br>
1. Examine the distribution/frequency counts of each variable
2. Examine the missingness of each variable, especially “unexpectedly missing” values
3. Determine whether any variable suffers from apparent quality control issues, such as data entry errors or rows that do not seem relevant to the issue at hand
4. Determine any formulaic connections between columns and confirm that the formula always works in each row
5. Search for clusters or subgroups of observations that seem to “behave” differently than the rest
<br>
The final project document contains the analysis and conclusion for the following business questions:
<br>
1. What is the business problem as you understand it?
<br>
2. What variables in the data relate most directly to the business problem?
<br>
3. Are there any data quality concerns with these variables?
<br>
4. Do you have any hypotheses about how the data could help to answer the business problem?
<br>
5. Are the data likely sufficient to confirm or reject your hypotheses? Consider data completeness, data quality, and methodological assumptions in your answer.  If not, what additional data or corrective measures are needed?
