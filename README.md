## Project Highlights

### 1. Chicago Taxi Trips Analysis
Analyzed 6.38M Chicago taxi trips across 23 variables using R and Python, applying statistical methods including linear regression, inference, and F-tests. Built interactive visualizations and prediction tools to evaluate trip patterns, durations, and citywide trends.

---

### 2. GenAI-Powered Legal Assistant (LexLead.AI)
Developed an open-source legal AI assistant specialized in Texas Family Law. Incorporated RAG pipelines, fine-tuning, safety alignment, and LLM-as-Judge evaluation, achieving an 80% improvement in accuracy over baseline models.

---

### 3. Receipt Volume Forecasting System
Built an end-to-end forecasting system to predict annual receipt volumes using daily historical data. Implemented Prophet, ARIMA, and XGBoost with cross-validation, feature engineering, and visualization to support revenue forecasting, staffing, and capacity planning.

---

### 4. Amazon Reviews Authenticity Analysis
Leveraged Google Cloud Dataproc and PySpark to analyze ~50GB of Amazon product reviews and detect patterns indicative of fraudulent or AI-generated content. Explored 5M+ products across 43 categories and 23 years, uncovering seasonality, reviewer behavior, and price–rating dynamics. Deployed an interactive EDA dashboard via Streamlit on Google Cloud Run.

---

### 5. Customer Churn Prediction for a Fitness Center
Developed machine learning classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Ensemble Models) to predict member churn. Enabled targeted retention strategies and improved customer engagement insights.

---

### 6. McDonald's Sales & Promotion Analysis
Assessed the impact of the All-Day Breakfast promotion using time-series analysis, A/B testing, and dashboarding. Measured effects on revenue growth, repeat visitation, and new customer acquisition.

---

### 7. Breast Cancer Prediction
Built predictive models using SVM, KNN, and Random Forests, with detailed feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning. Emphasized model accuracy, recall, and clinical interpretability for improved decision support.

---

### 8. Patient Readmission Analysis
Performed statistical and predictive analysis to examine hospital readmission drivers. Identified high-impact risk factors to support quality improvement and resource allocation.

---

### 9. Online Gaming Player Engagement Analysis
Developed a player engagement prediction model using gameplay behavior features. Identified key engagement drivers and recommended retention optimization strategies for game designers.
